* Social media platforms are a great way to stay connected, updated, and creating. However, there are quite a few negative effects that can alienate a number of its users. Noteful will allow its users to express their thoughts and ideas without all the fuss and pressures that regular social media site may have.

* AS A USER who uses social media for many reasons,
* I WANT a platform that I can sign-up for to post/upload notes, thoughts, reminders, and ideas,
* SO THAT I can easily look through my previous posts without the distractions of added feautures. 
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```

* AS AN AUTHENTICATED USER...
* WHEN the user navigates to the webpage
* THEN they are presented with the option to log in if they have an account, or sign-up if they do not have on yet
* WHEN the user provides the login credentials then they are taken to the Home page
* THEN they are presented with a header with a greeting and a text box where they could type and upload a post.
* IF they are not an AUTHENTICATED USER then they will be met with a home page that will have a carousel of note pages from sign-up users as a header and a timeline of other posts made by other users in the bpdy of the page.
